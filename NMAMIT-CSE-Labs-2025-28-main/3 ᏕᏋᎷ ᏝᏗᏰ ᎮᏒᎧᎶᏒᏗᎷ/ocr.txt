This is an OCR output of my lab program. Please correct only the syntax errors and formatting mistakes so that it compiles and runs, but keep everything else (structure, variable names, comments, and style) exactly the same as in the book/lab notes. Donâ€™t rewrite or optimize the code, just fix syntax."
